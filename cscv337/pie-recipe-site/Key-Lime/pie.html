            1.5 cups finely crushed graham cracker crumbs, from about
            12 whole graham crackers. <br>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F and set an 
                oven rack in the middle position.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, 
                brown sugar, and melted butter; stir with a fork 
                first, and then your hands until the mixture is well 
                combined. Using your fingers and the bottom of a glass
                or dry measuring cup, press the crumbs firmly into the 
                bottom and up the sides of a 9 x 1.5-inch (deep-dish) 
                pie pan. The crust should be about ¼-inch thick. (Tip: 
                do the sides first.)</li>
            <li>Bake for 10 minutes, until just slightly browned. 
                Let the crust cool on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="recipe-header-2">
            FOR THE FILLING
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Lower the oven temperature to 350°F.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sweetened condensed 
                milk, yogurt, lime zest, and lime juice. Pour the thick 
                mixture into the warm graham cracker crust. Bake for 15 
                minutes, until the filling is almost set; it should wobble
                a bit. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, then 
                place in the refrigerator to chill thoroughly, about 3 hours.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the heavy cream until 
                soft peaks form. Add the confectioners' sugar and beat until 
                medium peaks form. Top the pie with the whipped cream. Decorate 
                with the lime zest and lime slices. Store the pie in the 
                refrigerator until ready to serve. Slice the pie into wedges,
                 wiping your knife clean between slices, and serve cold.</li>
