                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this internship, I worked with the global marketing team in the Sales and Marketing Group. My main project revolved around developing a Microsoft SharePoint website to capture/track my team's KPIs. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I accomplished this task by conducting interviews with and gathering KPI data from my teammates in order to gain an understanding of their work. I then designed and built a SharePoint site that could appropriately fit the needs of my manager. In addition to this, I also became versed in PowerBI to design KPI trackers for the site.

                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this internship I worked with the NUC team to create, plan, and execute a collegiate roadshow event circuit. This involved designating stops, planning events at stops, designing the bus, and designing logos/merch. 
                            <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To accomplish this I had to manage the contributions and ideas of contributors across four companies and select universities. I also had to create the entire schedule, itinerary, and rally events (waiving the brand flag / giving out merch).
                            <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In addition to the above, I also learned a lot about interpersonal, coworker relationships and how to navigate tough times as my entire organization was released by Intel during my contract.
