                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this internship I worked with the global marketing team in the Sales and Marketing Group. My main project revolved around developing a Microsoft SharePoint website to capture/track my team's KPIs. 
                            <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I accomplished this task by conducting interviews with and gathering KPI data from my teammates in order to gain an understanding of their work. I then designed and built a SharePoint site that could appropriately fit the needs of my manager. In addition to this, I also became versed in PowerBI to design KPI trackers for the site.

                        <div class="job-description" style="line-height: 180%;"> <!-- NUC 2023 -->
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Managed the Intel side of the NUC Truck activation. My responsibilities included managing partnership relations, co-branding give/gets, end-user experiences, driving sales activations, university tour schedule, and documenting the process to preserve the idea. Also furthered Intel's goals to reach key demographics and use-cases.
                            <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In addition to the above, I also learned a lot about interpersonal, coworker relationships and how to navigate difficult and changing times as my entire organization was released by Intel during my contract.

                        <div class="job-description" style="line-height: 220%;"> <!-- CCG 2022 -->
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Managed, owned, and updated a comprehensive report on the current view of the assorted buckets in the gaming market. This included me reaching all across Intel for assorted data and combining it all together into the new, updated report. Upon completion I presented my findings out to my extended business group.
                            <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I also researched, developed, and presented out a grassroots in-person and virtual gaming event to further Intel's goals in the EDU esports gaming evironment.

                        <div class="job-description" style="line-height: 220%;"> <!-- CCG 2021 -->

                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this internship, I mainly focused on personifying nine gamer personas so my team could better market to them. I accomplished this by sifting through a gamer demographic database and creating comprehensive reports based on my findings. One of my primary accomplished goals was creating one-pagers for each persona. These one pagers including everything from demographic and buyer data to gaming and living habits. <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I also worked on various market research projects brought to me by teammates. This involved me taking notes on their questions, researching them, and creating a report out for either my entire team or the individual.
